The MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) may just be the biggest leap forward the smallest Pro line has experienced in years. By fitting it with the much-lauded 5nm M1 chip – the same one that powers the Mac mini (M1, 2020) and the MacBook Air (M1, 2020), Apple revived this already popular laptop in a way that none of its previous iterations ever could.

That’s despite the fact that the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) lacks major updates in the design department. While those would have made it a much more compelling purchase, this laptop is already worth the upgrade. With this new chip at its core, it delivers a much greater performance than the Intel CPUs powering its predecessor, being 2.8 times faster than the early 2020 model and three times quicker than equivalent Windows laptops. All while touting a longer battery life than the Intel models.

It’s true that there was a strong challenger or two during our M1 chip test like the AMD Ryzen 7 4800U-powered Lenovo Yoga Slim 7. And yet, the MacBook Pro 13-inch (M1, 2020) still meets almost our expectations. If Apple wanted to launch something revolutionary, it certainly managed that.
